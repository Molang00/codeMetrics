#### Project: Software Metrics

<a name="description"></a>

1. Description

In the words of Wikipedia, software metrics are standards of measure of a degree to which a software system or process possesses some property. In other words, it gives statistic inference and lots of clues for the evaluation. Since every programmer wants to be able to code neatly and coherently, implementing the plugin that giving mathematical information and imparting it effectively was enough to attract us to decide it as our project.
Our project would be implementing the IntelliJ plugin, which calculates some software metrics such as the Maintenance index. What we plan is not only calculating for those measures but also visualizing information to convey opportunities to check and consider about the code structure. We wish our project would be useful enough to help many programmers, and we dare.
