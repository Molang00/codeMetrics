# Software Matrix

#### Project 1: Software Metrics

Calculate a set of software metric(s) for a project of your choice, and visualize these metrics in an effective way. For example, you may show calculated metrics in a table (for each class or method), possibly together with red/yellow/green ratings like [Maintainability Index](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/zainnab/2011/05/26/code-metrics-maintainability-index). See the following links for a list of software metrics. You may want to implement a plugin that calculates and visualizes a subset of those metrics.

- [Martin's design quality metrics](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxkZWxsZGVza3RvcGZpbGVzfGd4OjJjOGM1MDk4ZGU5MzAwNjM)
- [Object-oriented metrics suite](http://www.aivosto.com/project/help/pm-oo-ck.html)

There is also an existing plugin to compute software metrics as follows. You may get some idea from the plugin, or even extend it with new functionalities or visualizations!
